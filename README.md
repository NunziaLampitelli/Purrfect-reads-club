# Purrfect Reads Club

This is the last individual project to develop using what we have learned in the last months.

I decided to create something similar to my last project but with more functions and a better styling.

I decided to use the Google Books API to make a personal library where people can search books and then add them in a favorites page.

There will be a login form and it will be developed with React+JSX.

This project at the moment is related to the idea of a club for people who like both reading and cats.
